It revolved around the general concepts of storytelling, and how stories can help shape the publics opinion on things, and especially emerging technologies. The exercise for the students revolved around the \"characteristics\" and \"experiences\" of one of two objects, either a nail or a toothpick. First, we had to characterize the object and then think about the experience from the objects perspective, and then we had to do the same thing but imagine it in a completely different historical context, like the middle ages or the roman empire. This was interesting, as it both highlighted that both of the objects probably didnt experience a lot of radical changes in the past couple of centuries, and also because it showed that many people formed different narratives around the objects despite all of them having the same task.</p>"},{"location":"Lesson-4/#takeaways","title":"Takeaways","text":"<p>The main takeaways from this lesson were that stories are an incredibly important and also potentially dangerous or manipulative tool.

The presentation was very interesting and served as a good recap of the texts we read. The exercise we had to do revolved around the concept of defamiliarisation. We all had to design a fridge for a specific user group, with a third of the class having to design a fridge for a dog, a third having to design a fridge for a plant, and the last third having to design a fridge for an A.I. This was interesting as it required us to think outside the box and try to throw any preconceptions we had about fridges out the window.</p> <p>Because the input from Oli was shorter as he was presenting alone, Jo\u00eblle gave another input afterwards, where we did an exercise. We had to individually answer these questions related to our group project:</p> <p>1) What criteria/aspect/quality is most important for you to achieve by the end? - A good video showcasing/explaining the original concept of the project, regardless of how the prototype turns out.</p> <p>2) What do you think it is for the audience? (be specific) - An interesting experiment to try and \"defamiliarize\" the stressy environment</p> <p>3) What do you think it is for your teachers? - A project to see if we learned anything from the IAD Methods/Process class </p> <p>4) One aspect you think the project should address but hasnt? - What to do after you step in the sand, and you have to put your shoes back on.</p> <p>It is interesting to note that our group all had completely different answers, but we had little time to compare and contrast because we had to get right back to work after the lecture.

The \"official\" evaluation is a form where you have to answer how much you agree with a certain number of questions (i think?) such as \"the amount of effort required correlates roughly to the amount of credits you get\", and \"i always felt respected\" etc. To contrast this, Jo\u00eblle made a Miro board where we could all write our own sentences to a few categories she prepared, such as \"what did you enjoy about hosting a session?\" or \"what did you appreciate in general in the design methods class so far?\" etc. This made the difference between qualitative and quantitive evaluation of something a lot more concrete for me. Another takeaway was the brief input from claudio about the difference of Design Fiction and Speculative Design which i found quite interesting, which is that Speculative Design is often more provocative and \"out there\", and Design Fiction tries to stay more grounded.</p>"}]}
