## Brief Summary of Lesson

The lesson was hosted by Lhamo and Anna
Lhamo talked about the "Sprint technique", and how exactly it works and how its implemented.

She described that a sprint has 5 acts:
1) Friendly Introduction
2) Context Question
3) Introducing the Prototype
4) Tasks and Interaction
5) Debrief and Reflection

#### Ground rules in sprint testing:

**Interviewer:**
- Ask open, natural questions
- dont lead or explain
- encourage users to think aloud

**Observers:**
- Stay silent and do not interfere
- Take detailed notes of key moments
- Use a shared template to capture findings accodringly

Anna was talking about the "Thinking-Aloud" Method

Anna mentioned that the user should be prepared
- Interface is evaluated, not the user
- Encourage honesty and explain why thoughts are helpful

Techniques:
- Prompting (neutral question)
- Echoing (repeating words)
- Summarize key points (actions and thoughts)

good tip: count to 10 before intervening

___

## Takeaways

The technique of counting to 10 before intervening was very eye opening for me, and a great technique that i will apply during our user testing.
