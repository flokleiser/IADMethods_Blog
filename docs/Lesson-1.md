!!! note
    i did not take any notes for the first lesson because JoÃ«lle said we shouldnt have our laptops open during the lesson. I only realized later that this probably was a misunderstanding

### Topic:

Introduction to the Course

### Reading Material:

None

### Brief Summary of Lesson:

The first lesson was an introduction to the course, going over the structure aswell as the assignment that we have to do in groups, where we are responsible for explaining one assigned topic from two different angles, and mediate a class lesson around the topic.

### Takeaways:

Many interesting names of designers and artists that i would love to research more, but sadly, i did not take any notes of their names because i thought we were not supposed to have our laptops open.
