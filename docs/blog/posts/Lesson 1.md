### Introduction to the Course

The first lesson was an introduction to the course, going over the structure aswell as the assignment that we have to do in groups, where we are responsible for explaining one assigned topic from two different angles, and mediate a class lesson around the topic.

!!! note
    i did not take any notes for the first lesson because Joëlle said we shouldnt have our laptops open during the lesson. I only realized later that this probably was a misunderstanding (?)
