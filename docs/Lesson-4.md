    - How does a filmmaker (or any storyteller) balance the ethics of "shaping" the future by portraying a technology in a certain way?

    4) **How does it affect your design practice? What applications do you see in your practice?**

    - Narratives (films or stories) can be used to reduce public anxiety of new technologies, stimulate desire in audiences, or also to warn of possible future events in the hopes of stimulating public action to prevent them from happening.

???+ abstract "Rosén, A. et al. 2022. "Towards More-Than-Human-Centred Design: Learning from Gardening". In International Journal of Design."

    [rosen.pdf](texts/week4/week4_rosen_et_al.pdf)

    1) **What are the new terms in this text? How are they defined? Where do they come from?**

    - More-Than-Human-Centered Design: expands human centered design to also include nonhuman actors.

    - Text was published in 2022

    3) **What questions come to your mind from reading this text?**

    - Will the principles of more-than-human centered design ever be widespread, or will it always be something that only people privileged enough (or that dont have to worry about hunger, survival, money etc) can afford to think about?
