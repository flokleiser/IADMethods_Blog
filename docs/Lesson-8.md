> 1) **What are the new terms in this text? How are they defined? Where do they come from?**
>- Jakob’s Law: users spend most of their time on other sites and prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. It reminds designers that people leverage previous experience to understand new experiences. The law is attributed to Jakob Nielsen.
>- Aesthetic–Usability Effect: means that users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable. It suggests that beautiful design creates a positive response and can make users more tolerant of minor usability issues. Its origins trace back to a 1995 study by Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura at the Hitachi Design Center, corroborated by later research.
>- Tesler’s Law: states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced. This inherent complexity must be handled by either the system (design/development) or the user. Its origins are traced back to Larry Tesler, a computer scientist at Xerox PARC in the mid-1980s.>
>
> 2) **Who are the authors? Where do they work? Who do they refer to?**
>
>- Jon Yablonski, self described designer, worked with numerous researchers and experts.
>
> 3) **What questions come to your mind from reading this text?**
>
>- Given that aesthetically pleasing design can sometimes mask usability issues (Aesthetic–Usability Effect), what specific strategies or testing methods can designers use to ensure they uncover genuine usability problems beyond surface appearance?
>
> 4) **How does it affect your design practice? What applications do you see in your practice?**
>
>- The text will help me a lot in justifying my design choices based on empirical evidence, because i often struggle to describe why some designs work better than others.
