>- Create Module: This module is used to design new or better solutions for users. It is where designers typically start
>- Evaluate Module: In this module, the role is that of critical minds who adjust and review solutions and make them usable for the company. It is used to contact users again and validate various aspects of an idea, such as its relevance, whether it solves the problem, and if users would use or pay for it
