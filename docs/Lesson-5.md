## Reading Material

> [!abstract]- "Baumer, E., Blythe M., and Tanenbaum, T. 2020. "Evaluating Design Fiction: The Right Tool for the Job". In Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference."

>
> 1) **What are the new terms in this text? How are they defined? Where do they come from?**
>
> - Design Fiction: a design practice aiming at exploring and criticising possible futures by creating speculative, and often provocative, scenarios narrated through designed artifacts (wikipedia)
> - ACM: Association for Computing Machinery
> - Evaluative Frame: structured approach that guides the process of evaluation
>
> 2) **Who are the authors? Where do they work? Who do they refer to?**
>
> - The paper was published in 2020
> - Baumer and Tannenbaum are academics in the field of Computer Science/Informatics, and Blythe is in the field of Design. All three authors have focused on the broad topic of HCI before.
>
> 3) **What questions come to your mind from reading this text?**
>
> - How can you extract the most of qualitative feedback, without exactly knowing where the persons biases are?
>
> 4) **How does it affect your design practice? What applications do you see in your practice?**
>
> - The paper focuses on how design fiction should be evaluated, and how this can be both more consistant and useful.
> - Bringing in "outside voices" is not always helpful, which is true in the field of Interaction Design/HCI, as well as practically all other artforms like literature, film, etc.
> - It is important to identify the "Primary Evaluative Frame" to better understand the critique.
> - There should not be a definite set of criteria to review design fiction or for small qualitative studies, as different people will focus on different evaluative frames.

> 1) **What are the new terms in this text? How are they defined? Where do they come from?**
>
> - Defamiliarization: The act of making the familiar seem unfamiliar, challenging conventional ways of thinking and creating new perspectives. This can for example be achieved by very literally explaining something using different terms than usual. It is _not_ a scientific method.
> - Naturalization: The process of cultural phenomena gradually becoming seen as "natural", until their cultural roots are obscured.
> - "Flow": peak experience of total absorption in an activity. Close match between skill and challenge, clear goals and constant feedback on performance, characterized by decrease in self-conciousness and time distortion.
>
> 2) **Who are the authors? Where do they work? Who do they refer to?**
>
> - The paper was written in 2003, published in 2004.
> - Blythe seems to have switched universities since this paper was written
> - Sengers is a professor in inforamtion science/science & technology stufies
> - Bell is now the vice-chancellor of the australian national university, and is credited with being an industry pioneer in the field of user experience. She is a cultural anthropologist.
>
> 3) **What questions come to your mind from reading this text?**
>
> - in which situations is a "defamiliarization" approach useful? Should it be used for almost any design question or should it only be reserved for when an existing design poses problems?
>
> 4) **How does it affect your design practice? What applications do you see in your practice?**
>
> - Exchanges with people outside of a certain "bubble" can help discover blindspots due to unfamiliarity of outsiders to an established system.
> - "Talking about something as if you were explaining it to someone from mars"
> - Defamiliarization is different from ethnography, because it does not explicitly focus on the users and their needs, but can also be incorporated in the design process itself.
> - A Historical and cultural analysis can help with the defamiliarization process.
> - i should read this text again in the future as i really enjoyed it and found it fascinating.
> - Defamiliarization can be especially helpful when trying to change gendered design legacies, as products such as clothing irons etc have been historically designed with a "female aesthetic", and by rethinking those design decisions, gendered design legacies (probably, maybe) can be altered.
> - Defamiliarization provides the "opportunity to _actively_ reflect on, rather than _passively_ propagate, the existing politics and culture of home life".

> 1) **What are the new terms in this text? How are they defined? Where do they come from?**
>
> - Usability testing: Evaluation that tests a users performance and evaluates their satisfaction with the system. Is done in a laboratory setting. Particularly important in later stages of design.
> - Field studies: Evaluation that is done in a natural environment as opposed to a controlled setting.
> - Analytical evaluation: Evaluations that dont involve end-users. Is done in a laboratory setting, often involving heuristics.
>
> 2) **Who are the authors? Where do they work? Who do they refer to?**
>
> - Book published in 2013
> - Preece is a professor at the University of Maryland. Notably, her research focuses on online communities and is known for her work on what makes online communities successful, which i find really interesting.
> - Rogers is a british psychologist and computer scientist. She has a PhD in HCI, And she was/is professor at multiple prestigious english universities.
> - Sharp is a Mathematician, Computer Science postgraduate and professor in Software Engineering, focusing on HCI, Software Engineering and Project Management.
>
> 3) **What questions come to your mind from reading this text?**
>
> - How are the priorities of the issues assigned, what distinguishes medium from low priority etc.?
>
> 4) **How does it affect your design practice? What applications do you see in your practice?**
>
> - Designers are often not the target user population, so it is important to get as much evaluation from as many different user groups as possible.
> - the success of an interactive products depends doesnt depend on usability alone. Aesthetic, emotional, engaging and motivating qualities are equally important.
> - Evaluation methods are often used together or chained together.
> - It is likely that every iteration of testing/evaluating will reveal new areas where improvements can be made, so knowing when its time to move on is important.
